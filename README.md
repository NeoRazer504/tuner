# Tuner
This is a chromatic instrument tuner I made for myself because I'm a band nerd and I need a better tuner so instead of buying one, I thought it would be better to make one :). (This is my first custom non guided project so hope it works).
## Features
- Powered by a Xiao nRF52840
- Built in microphone and a jack so you can choose to use a external mic instead
- 2.42" OLED
- 3 LEDs to indicate if you're flat, sharp, or in tune
- 2 buttons to adjust hertz
- 500 mAh battery
